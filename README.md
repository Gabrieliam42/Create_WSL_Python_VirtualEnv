# Create_Linux_Python_Virtual_Environment

Prerequisites:
`Python`
`venv`
So you need to install venv for every version of Python you have installed. You can do this with the following commands:
`sudo apt-get install python3.10-venv`
`sudo apt-get install python3.11-venv`
`sudo apt-get install python3.12-venv`
`sudo apt-get install python3.13-venv`

With this script you can create a Linux Python Environment inside WSL, WSL2 terminal or Bash.

* In Windows you can run "Run_WSL_Python_Script.exe" and select "Create_WSL_Python3.10_VirtualEnv_.venv.py".
* You can do this by running the WSL terminal or Bash and by using the following command:
###### python3 Create_WSL_Python3.10_VirtualEnv_.venv.py
* Or in cmd by using the command `wsl python3 Create_WSL_Python3.10_VirtualEnv_.venv.py`

This creates a Linux Python Virtual Environment named .venv and also activates it, so you can immediately install Python libraries inside the environment.
