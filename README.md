# Create_WSL_Python_VirtualEnv

With this script you can create a Linux Python Environment inside WSL or WSL 2.

* You can do this by running the WSL Environment and by using the following command:
###### python3 Create_WSL_Python3.10_VirtualEnv_.venv.py

This creates a Linux Python Virtual Environment named .venv and activates it.
