# Create_Linux_Python_Virtual_Environment

With this script you can create a Linux Python Environment inside WSL, WSL 2 or in a bash terminal.

* You can do this by running the WSL Environment or Bash and by using the following command:
###### python3 Create_WSL_Python3.10_VirtualEnv_.venv.py

This creates a Linux Python Virtual Environment named .venv and also activates it, so you can immediately install Python libraries inside.
